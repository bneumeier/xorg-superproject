This is a frame project that makes it easy to set up a complete
xorg git directory to track the entire project.  Actually, in
addition to xorg, it tracks a majority of the git repositories
hosted on freedesktop.org.

Each individual repository on freedesktop.org is set up as a
submodule here.  I periodically update the commits referenced in
each submodule, but you can do the same thing just by checking
out the master branch in the submodules that interest you.

To track everything, initialize and then update all of the
submodules:

git submodule update --init

Or, if you don't want to bother with some of the modules, "git
submodule init" only the ones that interest you and then "git
submodule update" as a separate operation.

There's a handy script under xorg that lets you export the latest
released version of every xorg module to a separate directory
structure.  It's written in ruby, so you'll need that.  Running
it is simple:

cd xorg
bundle install
bundle exec ruby export-latest.rb $TARGET_PATH

The script will export the latest tag of each submodule to a
directory structure under TARGET_PATH, e.g. /tmp/xorg or wherever
you prefer.  (By preference it exports the latest release tag;
when there's no module release tag it exports the latest XORG
release tag; ande when there aren't any tags at all, nothing is
exported.)
